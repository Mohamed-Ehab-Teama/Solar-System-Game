I wanna a website: it will be a game about exploring the space.
It will be levels, in each level, there will be sessions. in each session, we will know many information about space, solar system, eclipses and so on.
When we know the information, we will achieved this session of the level and get coins and go to the next session of the level.
And when we achieve all the sessions of the level, there will be a quiz.
We must achieve more than 70% of that quiz to achieve this level and go to the next level.
The Quiz will give you extra coins depending on your score if you achieved the quiz.
The coins: by coins, you will be able to change you avatar, choses a planet to live on, update the planet, and so on.
I wanna the website responsive, looks great, and having 3D photos and videos and tutorials.
I wanna it take the first place in the competition please.
and I appreciate a lot your help .
Thanks Brother
